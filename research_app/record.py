"""Record the agent workflow without waiting for simulated delays (Part 1).

Staff build the D-family traces this way from the reference agent; the Part 1
tests use it to check your agent's trace export: `record_reports` and then
`to_trace_job` for each recording. Record mode never sleeps: the FakeLLM
answers instantly and tool latencies are sampled and recorded, keyed by
(seed, op id, attempt), so the same inputs always give the same recordings
regardless of scheduling.

    for rec, arrival in zip(recs, arrivals):
