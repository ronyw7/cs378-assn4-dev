"""Prefix-aware eviction and cache-aware routing (Part 2, tasks 2.2 and 2.3).

choose_victim: evict the least recently used cached block that is a leaf of
its replica's prefix tree (no resident block on that replica extends it), and
fall back to plain LRU when no candidate is a leaf. Track the tree from alloc
and evict events; do not read view.blocks.

route_call: among replicas whose in_flight is at most `balance_threshold`
above the least loaded replica's, send the call to the one holding the most
cached blocks of its prompt; break ties by lower in_flight, then lower replica
id. This follows the cache-aware policy of SGLang's router.

params: cap (default 8); leaf_first (default True; False gives plain LRU);
balance_threshold (default 1; -1 routes to the least loaded replica, like the
reference). With leaf_first=False and balance_threshold=-1, this policy makes
the same decisions as the reference.
